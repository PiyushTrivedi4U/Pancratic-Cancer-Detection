# Pancreatic Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
### Introduction
This project aims to detect pancreatic cancer using machine learning algorithms. We have employed Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers to build predictive models based on clinical data.

Data
The dataset should be in CSV format and include relevant clinical features for pancreatic cancer detection. Ensure that your dataset is placed in the data directory and named raw_data.csv. The preprocessing script will handle data cleaning and preparation.

Models
Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification problems. In this project, we used it as a baseline model.

Decision Tree
Decision Tree is a non-parametric model that splits the data based on feature values. It is intuitive and easy to interpret.

Random Forest
Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

Results
After training and evaluating the models, the results are as follows:

Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of X% with an AUC of Y.
Decision Tree: Achieved an accuracy of X% with an AUC of Y.
Random Forest: Achieved an accuracy of X% with an AUC of Y.
For detailed results and analysis, refer to the evaluate_models.py script and the accompanying notebook in the notebooks directory.
